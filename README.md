## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before using this workflow, ensure you have:

- **GitLab Access**: Admin or Developer role on your GitLab project
- **GitLab Token**: Personal access token with `api` scope
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Code, ChatGPT, or similar AI coding assistant
- **Tools**: `curl`, `jq` (optional but recommended)

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-dev-review-workflow.git
cd ai-dev-review-workflow
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (already in `.gitignore`):

```bash
# .env file
export GITLAB_URL="https://your-gitlab-instance.com"
export GITLAB_TOKEN="glpat-your-personal-access-token"
export PROJECT_PATH="group/subgroup/project-name"
```

Load the environment:
```bash
source .env
```

### 3. Test GitLab Connection

```bash
# Test API access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_PATH" | jq '.name'
```

## 📋 Complete Workflow Guide

### Step 1: Extract Issues from GitLab

#### 1.1 Fetch Issues via API

```bash
# Get all open issues
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_PATH/issues?state=opened" \
  > issues.json

# Get specific issue by ID
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_PATH/issues/123" \
  > issue-123.json
```

#### 1.2 Format Issues Using Template

Use the `extract-issues-template.md` with your AI assistant:

**AI Prompt Example:**
```
Use the extract-issues-template.md to format this GitLab issues data:

[paste issues.json content]

Fill in these variables:
- PROJECT_NAME: "E-Recruitment Suite"
- PROJECT_PATH: "thaibev/hr/e-recruitment"
- BOARD_URL: "https://gitlab.thaibev.com/thaibev/hr/e-recruitment/-/boards"
- CURRENT_DATE: "2024-01-15"
```

### Step 2: Review Branch Implementation

#### 2.1 Identify Branch for Review

Find the branch associated with the issue:

```bash
# List all branches
git branch -r | grep -E "(issue-123|RTRER-123|feature/issue-123)"

# Or search by issue number in branch names
git branch -r | grep "123"
```

#### 2.2 Analyze Branch Changes

```bash
# Compare branch with main
git diff main..feature/issue-123

# Get commit history
git log --oneline main..feature/issue-123

# Check file changes
git diff --name-only main..feature/issue-123
```

#### 2.3 AI-Assisted Code Review

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Review this branch against Issue #123 requirements:

ISSUE REQUIREMENTS:
[paste issue requirements from GitLab]

BRANCH: feature/issue-123

FILES CHANGED:
[paste git diff --name-only output]

CODE CHANGES:
[paste relevant git diff sections]

REVIEW CRITERIA:
- Implementation completeness
- Code quality and standards
- Security considerations
- Test coverage
- Documentation
- Error handling

Based on your analysis, determine if this should use:
- ready-to-merge.md (excellent work)
- critical-issues.md (serious problems)
- minor-improvements.md (good work with suggestions)
```

### Step 3: Generate Feedback Using Templates

#### 3.1 Choose Appropriate Template

| Template | When to Use | Quality Score |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `ready-to-merge.md` | All requirements met, excellent code quality | 8-10/10 |
| `minor-improvements.md` | Good implementation with minor suggestions | 6-8/10 |
| `critical-issues.md` | Security issues, broken functionality, missing requirements | 0-5/10 |

#### 3.2 Fill Template Variables

**For `ready-to-merge.md`:**
```
DEVELOPER: john.doe
FEATURE_NAME: User Authentication System
REQUIREMENTS: ["Login functionality", "Password reset", "Session management"]
BONUS_FEATURES: [{"feature_name": "2FA Support", "description": "Added optional two-factor authentication"}]
QUALITY_SCORE: 9
EXCELLENCE_REASONS: ["Clean, maintainable code", "Comprehensive test coverage", "Proper error handling"]
BRANCH_NAME: feature/issue-123
SPECIFIC_PRAISE: "The security implementation is particularly impressive."
```

**AI Prompt for Template Generation:**
```
Using the ready-to-merge.md template, generate feedback for:

Developer: @john.doe
Feature: User Authentication System
Branch: feature/issue-123
Requirements: [list from issue]
Quality Score: 9/10

Fill in all template variables and generate the final markdown output.
```

### Step 4: Post Feedback to GitLab

#### 4.1 Format for GitLab

```bash
# Save generated feedback to file
cat > feedback.md << 'EOF'
[paste your generated feedback here]
EOF
```

#### 4.2 Post Comment via API

```bash
# Post feedback as issue comment
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_PATH/issues/123/notes" \
  -d "{\"body\": \"$(cat feedback.md | sed 's/"/\\"/g' | tr '\n' ' ')\"}"
```

#### 4.3 Update Issue Status (Optional)

```bash
# Mark issue as ready for merge
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_PATH/issues/123" \
  -d '{"labels": "ready-for-merge"}'
```

## 📄 Template Reference

### Available Templates

| Template | Purpose | Variables |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `extract-issues-template.md` | Format GitLab issues data | `PROJECT_NAME`, `PROJECT_PATH`, `BOARD_URL`, `CURRENT_DATE` |
| `ready-to-merge.md` | Excellent implementations | `DEVELOPER`, `FEATURE_NAME`, `REQUIREMENTS`, `QUALITY_SCORE` |
| `critical-issues.md` | Security/critical problems | `DEVELOPER`, `FEATURE_NAME`, `CRITICAL_ISSUES`, `FIXES_REQUIRED` |
| `minor-improvements.md` | Good work with suggestions | `DEVELOPER`, `FEATURE_NAME`, `IMPROVEMENTS`, `OPTIONAL_ENHANCEMENTS` |

### Template Syntax

All templates use **Mustache syntax**:

```mustache
# Variables
{{VARIABLE_NAME}}

# Conditional sections
{{#SECTION_NAME}}
Content shown if SECTION_NAME exists
{{/SECTION_NAME}}

# Lists
{{#LIST_NAME}}
- {{item_property}}
{{/LIST_NAME}}
```

## 🔍 Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing Multiple Issues

```bash
# Process all open issues
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_PATH/issues?state=opened" | \
  jq -r '.[].iid' | \
  while read issue_id; do
    echo "Processing issue #$issue_id"
    # Add your review logic here
  done
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` job:

```yaml
review_branches:
  stage: review
  script:
    - git fetch origin
    - ./scripts/auto-review.sh $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

### Custom Template Creation

Create your own templates following the Mustache syntax:

```mustache
# my-custom-template.md
## Custom Review for {{FEATURE_NAME}}

Hi @{{DEVELOPER}},

{{#CUSTOM_CHECKS}}
- {{check_name}}: {{status}}
{{/CUSTOM_CHECKS}}

{{#RECOMMENDATIONS}}
### {{category}}
{{#items}}
- {{item}}
{{/items}}
{{/RECOMMENDATIONS}}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. GitLab API Authentication Error**
```bash
# Check token permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/user"
```

**2. Project Path Not Found**
```bash
# Find correct project path
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects" | jq '.[].path_with_namespace'
```

**3. Template Variables Not Rendering**
- Ensure all variables are properly defined
- Check Mustache syntax (double curly braces)
- Verify conditional sections have proper opening/closing tags

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose output:
```bash
export DEBUG=1
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  "$GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_PATH/issues"
```
